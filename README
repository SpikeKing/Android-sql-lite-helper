Sql lite helper is a python script that generates automatically a dbadapter class useful for sqlite interaction in android.

You need to provide it an input file with the description of the classes that you are going to store in sqlite

The structure of the input file is:
CLASS ClassName
JavaType	FieldName
ENDCLASS

At the moment the only supported types are String, Float, Long and Date
You can put more than one class in the same file.


The usage is pretty simple. Provide the input file, the name of the class you want to create and the name of the package you want the class to belong to.

  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -i INFILE, --infile=INFILE
                        file that contains classes definition
  -n NAME, --name=NAME  name of the dbhelper class
  -p PACKAGE, --package=PACKAGE
                        name of the package


ie:
python sql_lite_helper.py -i sample.txt -n MyDbAdapter -p com.fede
